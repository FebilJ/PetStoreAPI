#Petstore API - Overview
The Petstore API is a sample RESTful API provided by Swagger (OpenAPI) to demonstrate API functionalities for an online pet store. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on different resources such as pets, users, and store orders.

Key Features of Petstore API:
Pet Management: Add, update, delete, and retrieve pet details.

User Management: Create user accounts, manage login, and update profiles.

Store Operations: Place orders, check inventory, and track order status.

Automated Testing Implementation:
Using REST Assured, Java, Maven, TestNG, and Page Object Model (POM), I built an automation framework for API testing. The tests validate functional correctness, response time, and schema compliance for endpoints like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Logging & Reporting: Integrated Log4j2 for debugging and Extent Reports for execution tracking.

CI/CD Integration: Automated API tests using Jenkins pipelines, ensuring continuous testing.

Version Control: Managed source code with Git & GitHub.

This automation ensures the reliability and stability of the API by identifying defects early in the development lifecycle. ðŸš€
